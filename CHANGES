Version 1.0 January 1997

 Changes that are not upwardly compatible:
  o read_watch changed to a subroutine, instead of a function
  o names of the *_group routines (create, destroy, join and leave) changed
    to *_watchgroup
  o sequence removed from type definitions (may effect codes with a watch or
    watchgroup in common or equivalence on some compilers)

 New features:
  o print format specification (sec, hh:mm:ss or [[hh:]mm:]ss) added to
    print_watch, option_stopwatch and inquiry_stopwatch
  o many internal syntax changes to support F and Elf90 subset languages
  o cpu_second based on Fortran 95 intrinsic cpu_time added
  o makefiles for several more environments

 Incidental:
  o a few bug fixes and compiler bug workarounds
  o makefiles renamed mf.<os>.<cpusec>.<compiler>
  o blank line not printed in print_watch when title or watch%name is empty
  o cpu_second routines changed to free format when possible
  o example program 'crash' renamed to 'bomb' (crash is a unix command)
