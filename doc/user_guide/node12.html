Although Fortran 90 standardized an intrinsic function for wall clock time,
it does not include a function for CPU time.  At the time of this writing,
it is anticipated that a CPU time intrinsic function will be added to the
language in Fortran 95.  If this happens, then StopWatch  can become fully
system independent once Fortran 95 compilers are widespread.  Meanwhile,
StopWatch  requires that a system dependent CPU time subroutine be provided
by the user.  Several versions of this subroutine are included with the
StopWatch  package.  One of these may work on your system.
The version <i> cpusec.nil.f</i>
contains no CPU clock information, and can be used on systems where
there is no routine to measure CPU time.  If this routine is used,
only the wall clock will be available.

<P>
If none of these versions work on your system, you will have to write your
own version.  The interface is
<P>
<PRE>subroutine cpu_second(cpu,user,sys)
real, intent(OUT) :: cpu, user, sys
</PRE>
<P>
The first argument is for CPU time in seconds.  Where available, the second
and third arguments should break down the CPU time into ``user'' and ``system''
CPU time.  If the underlying system does not provide for a way of accessing
the breakdown (i.e., has only CPU time), then return a negative constant in
<i> user</i> and <i> sys</i> (for example, <tt> user=-1.; sys=-1.</tt>).
The value returned in <i> cpu</i> (and
<i> user</i> and <i> sys</i> where available) should be a nonnegative real number such that
the difference between two successive calls is the amount of elapsed CPU time
in seconds.
<P>
If you write a new version of <b> cpu_second</b>  because none
of the supplied versions worked on your system, please send this information
to the author so that it can be included in the next release.
