StopWatch  is a Fortran 90 module for measuring execution time of program
segments.  Measuring execution time is an important part of software
development, especially for benchmarking and performance tuning.  Unfortunately,
Fortran has never supported the measurement of execution time, except through
non-portable vendor extensions.  Fortran 90 introduced a subroutine for
measuring wall clock time, but overlooked the more desirable CPU time.  It
is anticipated that the next Fortran standard, Fortran 95, will include a
CPU time subroutine, but it does not break the time into ``user'' and
``system'' time like many CPU clock routines, and the standard still does
not guarantee that either
the wall clock or CPU clock routines will necessarily contain clock
information.  Moreover, direct use of the routines can be unwieldy, requiring
multiple variables to keep track of returned values, differencing the
returned values, and conversion of the values to useful units.
<P>
StopWatch  is designed to be a portable, easy-to-use means of measuring
execution time.  It supports the wall clock, CPU clock, a breakdown of the
CPU clock into user and system times, and returns all times in seconds.
It provides a simple means of determining which clocks are available,
and the precision of those clocks.  It is written in a style that allows it
to be used with the subset languages ELF90 and F, as well as full Fortran 90
and Fortran 95 compilers.
<P>
StopWatch  is used by instrumenting your code with subroutine calls that
mimic the operation of a stop watch.  The primary routines are <b> start_watch</b>,
<b> stop_watch</b>, <b> reset_watch</b>, <b> read_watch</b>  and <b> print_watch</b>.  StopWatch  supports multiple watches,
and provides the concept of watch groups to allow functions to operate on
multiple watches simultaneously.
