<P>
A watch is a variable declared to be of type <tt> watchtype</tt>.  It can be passed
to subroutines as an actual argument or through modules
like any Fortran variable, but can only be operated
on by the StopWatch  subroutines.  Watches must be created by
subroutine <b> create_watch</b>  before they are
used.  Attempting to use a watch that has not been created will generate a
Fortran 90 error, from attempting to pass a pointer with undefined association
status to the Fortran intrinsic function <b> associated</b>.  Watches must be
destroyed when no longer useful.  For example, consider a local variable of
type <tt> watchtype</tt>  in a subroutine.  Since the contents of a local variable are
lost when the subroutine returns, the watch should be destroyed before returning
to the calling program.  Failure to destroy watches can lead to a memory leak.
<P>
<UL><LI> <b> create_watch</b>  -- creates a watch
<LI> <b> destroy_watch</b>  -- destroys a watch
</UL>
<P>
Watches can optionally be given a name (up to 132 characters) through an optional
argument, <i> name</i>, in <b> create_watch</b>.  This name is used in error messages and
<b> print_watch</b>  to identify the watch in the printed output.
<P>
Different applications demand different definitions of ``time''.
StopWatch  supports four clocks in each watch, with each clock measuring a
different concept of time.  All of them measure time in seconds.
<P>
<UL><LI> user -- the amount of CPU time used by the user's program
<LI> sys -- the amount of CPU time used by the system in support of the
user's program
<LI> cpu -- the total CPU time, i.e., user+sys
<LI> wall -- the wall clock time, i.e., elapsed real time
</UL>
<P>
It is not required that all clocks be used.  A watch can be created with
any combination of the four clocks.  You can also specify a set of
<em> default clocks</em> to be used whenever the clocks are not explicitly
determined.
<P>
Since Fortran 90 does not contain an intrinsic function for CPU time, the
implementation of the cpu, sys and user clocks is system dependent.  Some
implementations may support only cpu and wall, not user and sys.  Some
implementations may support only wall.  Since the Fortran 90 standard
requires the existence of a <b> system_clock</b> subroutine, but does not
require that it provide clock information, it is possible that some
implementations might not support wall.  Clock availability can be determined
by <b> inquiry_stopwatch</b>  (see Section <A HREF="node9.html#opt">4.4</A>).  Unavailable clocks will automatically
be removed from the set of default clocks, but if a clock that is not available
is explicitly requested, a warning message will be generated.
<P>
StopWatch  supports multiple watches simultaneously.  Often it is useful to
perform the same operation on several watches.  This is essential for correct
operation of <b> pause_watch</b>  and <b> end_pause_watch</b>  and is convenient for
procedures like <b> read_watch</b>, <b> print_watch</b>  and <b> reset_watch</b>.  To facilitate this,
StopWatch  supports the concept of <em> watch groups</em>.  When calling a
StopWatch  subroutine, a watch group can be specified instead of a watch.  The
group is referenced by a variable of type <tt> watchgroup</tt>.
Watch groups must be created before they are used.
Attempting to use a watch group that has not been created will generate a
Fortran 90 error, from attempting to pass a pointer with undefined association
status to the Fortran intrinsic function <b> associated</b>.
Watch groups must be
destroyed when no longer useful.
The watches themselves are not destroyed, only the grouping of them.
Failure to destroy watch groups can lead to a memory leak.
<P>
<UL><LI> <b> create_watchgroup</b>  -- creates a new watch group
<LI> <b> destroy_watchgroup</b>  -- destroys a watch group (but not the watches in the group)
</UL>
<P>
Most StopWatch  subroutines take <i> watch</i> as the first dummy argument, and
accept several forms of <i> watch</i>.  The forms are:
<P>
<UL><LI> type (watchtype) watch -- a single watch
<LI> type (watchtype) watch(:) -- an array of watches
<LI> type (watchgroup) watch -- a watch group handle
</UL>
<P>
In most StopWatch  routines, an array of watches can be specified by an array
constructor in the calling statement, for example:
<P>
<PRE>type (watchtype) watch :: w1, w2, w3
call print_watch( (/w1,w2,w3/) )
</PRE>
<P>
However, this can not be used in routines where
<i> watch</i> has intent OUT or intent INOUT, because the array constructor
is actually an expression, not a list of the variables.  Currently
this includes the routines <b> create_watch</b>  and <b> destroy_watch</b>.
<P>
Most StopWatch  subroutines take <i> clock</i> as the (optional) second dummy
argument to determine which of the four clocks will be affected by the
action.  <i> clock</i> can be one of the character strings 'user', 'sys', 'cpu',
or 'wall', or can be an array of such character strings to specify more
than one clock.  Since <i> clock</i> is always intent IN, an array of clock
types can be built with an array
constructor. However, note that Fortran 90 requires all character strings
in such a construction to have the same length.  Thus 'sys' and 'cpu'
should be padded with a blank, as in:
<P>
<PRE>call start_watch(watch, (/'user','sys ','cpu '/) )
</PRE>
<P>
If the optional argument <i> clock</i> is omitted, the current set of default
clocks is used.  The set of default clocks is set with <b> option_stopwatch</b>  (see Section
<A HREF="node9.html#opt">4.4</A>) and initially consists of all available clocks.
