This is StopWatch Version 1.0.

StopWatch is a Fortran 90 module for portable, easy-to-use measurement of
execution time.  It supports four clocks -- wall clock, CPU clock,
user CPU clock and system CPU clock -- and returns all times in seconds.
It provides a simple means of determining which clocks are available,
and the precision of those clocks.  It is written in a style that allows
it to be used with the subset languages Elf90 and F, as well as full
Fortran 90 and Fortran 95 compilers.

StopWatch is used by instrumenting your code with subroutine calls that
mimic the operation of a stop watch.  StopWatch supports multiple watches,
and provides the concept of watch groups to allow functions to operate on
multiple watches simultaneously.
 
Documentation is contained in subdirectory doc.  You can:

1) view user_guide.ps with a postscript previewer
2) print user_guide.ps on a postscript printer
3) view user_guide/user_guide.html with a Web browser (e.g. netscape)
4) read the man pages by adding <path>/stopwatch/man to your MANPATH (where
   <path> is the directory above this one)

You can initially avoid reading the user's guide by reading the file QUICKSTART.

The StopWatch module, example programs, and makefiles are in subdirectory src.
