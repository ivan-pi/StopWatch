This section provides just enough information to start using the basic features
of StopWatch.  If you run into trouble or want to learn about the advanced
features, read the StopWatch User's Guide and the man pages.

1. Select a makefile that matches the configuration of your
system.  If you don't find your system, select a makefile for a similar
system and modify it.  The makefile contains examples of how to compile
your program along with StopWatch.

2. Using an example target (for example, ``simple'') as a model,
modify the makefile to compile your program.

3. In each program unit that calls a StopWatch subroutine, insert
the statement

      use stopwatch

4. Declare one or more variables to be of type watchtype, for example

      type (watchtype) w

5. Instrument your code as appropriate with subroutine calls:

      call create_watch(w)
      call start_watch(w)
      call stop_watch(w)
      call reset_watch(w)
      call print_watch(w)
      call read_watch(val,w,s)
      call destroy_watch(w)

where s in read_watch is one of the character strings 'cpu',
'user', 'sys', or 'wall', depending on what clock you want to read, and
val is a real variable (of default kind) in which the clock value is returned.
